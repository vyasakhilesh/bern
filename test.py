PURPOSE: CLAPO syndrome is a rare vascular disorder characterized by capillary malformation of the lower lip, lymphatic malformation predominant on the face and neck, asymmetry, and partial/generalized overgrowth. Here we tested the hypothesis that, although the genetic cause is not known, the tissue distribution of the clinical manifestations in CLAPO seems to follow a pattern of somatic mosaicism. METHODS: We clinically evaluated a cohort of 13 patients with CLAPO and screened 20 DNA blood/tissue samples from 9 patients using high-throughput, deep sequencing. RESULTS: We identified five activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene in affected tissues from 6 of the 9 patients studied; one of the variants (NM_006218.2:c.248T>C; p.Phe83Ser) has not been previously described in developmental disorders. CONCLUSION: We describe for the first time the presence of somatic activating PIK3CA mutations in patients with CLAPO. We also report an update of the phenotype and natural history of the syndrome."})}
